Today, they are numbered among the protagonists of the dark electronic music scene. At the beginning of their career, Selofan had been stamped as a minimal-synth act, but their style possesses an extraordinary variety. By combining different elements of electronic music, singing and storytelling in different languages, and presenting themselves in such a theatrical way that each live performance is emotionally overwhelming, they developed their own audiovisual mix. This has enabled Selofan to establish their own musical and aesthetical identity, which is underlined by the artwork accompanying their releases and their videos."

Focused on ancient Scandinavia, the band rapidly evolved into an authentic music ensemble, thorough yet in the same time innovative. Their music is mostly based on the sources from Poetic Edda, performed on the original Old Islandic. Both male and female voices are used with regards to reflecting the old vocal techniques. Notably outstanding on the Russian scene and largely compared with the legendary Wardruna, NYTT LAND are unique in their devotion to the ritual Northern music and tradition that comes along with a great talent. Their almost reenacting approach, genuine native hand-crafted instruments and colossal enthusiasm help them to grasp the true spirit of ancient Northern music like no one in Eastern Europe has done before."

      "description": "Born in The Hague on the 16th of September 1973, Erwin van Kan started his career back in his infant-years. Jumping on a piano, smashing it, and then falling on a table with his head, leaving a nasty mark on his eyebrow! Maybe his Hardcore-style was already born? :) Around 1993, he began spinning music with a tape-recorder and some sort of turntable. Cutted, pasted, and recorded several mix-tapes during that time. After a couple of years he managed to build his own studio. He bought some equipment, like a small sampler, and he produced several tracks, not released on vinyl, but just for friends... Then, when he spinned as a DJ in a coffeeshop, he managed to produce a demo-tape which he gave to a friend, who had some connections in the record-business. Then he had the opportunity to release his first record : 'All that she wants' on Bünkor Beats-records. At that time he was booked at several small parties, and some of them were very underground. For some people in his country, they know wich underground-party we mean: The massive 'squat'-party, downtown The Hague! With lots of other DJ's like Virus, the english DJ Raw (not the mc), and many more... DJ Mystic (Nosferatu's first DJ-name) spinned for over 7 hours non-stop that night! After several years of working (more as a DJ, than a producer) he bought some new equipment and made a new demo. One day DJ Ruffneck was performing at a party, and Nosferatu gave his demo to him. Then his career really started; he got an appointment with P.v.Kerckhoven (Ruffneck) and Andrea v.d. Rhee from Cardiac Music bv. and he became part of a great recordcompany! 'Inspiration vibes', 'Dangerous Battle', and many more were made by the hand of Nosferatu. The name Nosferatu is a project name which  came up with for an early release on  together with Fred Henderson. The alias was later used as a project name by Van Kerckhoven and Erwin van Kan. The latter is now the solo user of the moniker. Because Van Kan has produced the bulk of the Nosferatu material."

      "description": "Linear Movement was a side-project of Peter Bonne between 1982 and 1984, next to his activities in Autumn and Twilight Ritual. Because of the difference in musical style, he decided this music should be part of a different project, which he baptized ‘Linear Movement’. Most of the tracks were solo experiments, but in some of them, he was joined by Peter Koutstaal (who also performed in Autumn), and by Lieve Van Steerteghem, who took the vocal part in some tracks. Linear Movement never made a tape release, but many tracks appeared on compilation projects throughout the world. The Micrart releases of Linear Movement are limited to a single C30-release MC 8208 ‘Pulse Music’, which contained early material by Peter solo, and a major contribution to the Line Compilation MC 8340. Peter wanted to experiment with more poppy compositions as Twilight Ritual and Autumn were more experimental. This direction was already taken when Autumn shifted from pure cosmic electronic music-based inspiration towards song-based compositions (refer to MC 8204 Not Afraid To Die). However, this mixture of experiments needed guidance and a certain separation. The poppy songs now resided under Linear Movement. It was a boiling pot and learning curve for Peter's later work with A Split-Second. Linear Movement is still performing live."

      "description": "Void Vision is a Philadelphia-based electronic project helmed by Shari Vari. It began around 2009 at a time when a wave of synth-revivalists were materializing, but the quality of the songwriting and intense vocals set the band apart from the pack. In a rare instance, Void Vision has managed to combine vintage dance elements with melodic structures, haunting melancholy, and lyrics that have a palpable soul. The songs themselves are dynamic, referencing a cross-section of the last 30 years of electronic music, while simultaneously retaining a uniqueness all their own. The infamous Wierd Records weekly club night in New York, which showcased a variety of talented electronic and coldwave artists, served as an incubator for Void Vision in it’s early stages. After a standout debut performance at the club, they immediately caught the attention of Blind Prophet Records, who consequently released their first 7″ single, ‘In 20 Years’, which received excellent reviews. Vari has continued performing and recording steadily over the last few years, releasing songs on compilations for various labels, including Rough Trade, and in 2012 the song ‘Everything is Fine’ was selected for Artforum magazine’s ‘Best of 2012′ issue. In 2013, Void Vision toured the West Coast and later that year released a split 12″ with Portland-based band, Vice Device. The first official full-length album, entitled ‘Sub Rosa’ is set to debut on Berlin-based Mannequin Records, followed by a European tour in 2015. Shari Vari formed Void Vision in 2009 originally as a duo, during the explosion of the new minimal synth and cold wave scene in United States. Sharing the same scene of the Wierd Records associates like Led Er Est, Martial Canterel, Xeno & Oaklander, Automelodi, in 2010 VV released ‘In Twenty Years’ on Blind Prophet (Sean Ragon’s Cult Of Youth record label), receiving also the attention of the Rough Trade dudes, who asked to put out a track for one of their synth wave compilations. After other split vinyls, tapes and compilations, Mannequin approached Shari with the intention to continue what Wierd Records started, giving a proper shape to her beautiful and youthful dark electronic sound. The result is 10 hypnotic cold analog tracks dominated by the warm and fragile Shari’s voice, some more “pop orientated” some others belonging to the original “cold wave” atmosphere."

      "description": "Hailing from Jersey, Channel Islands, Turquoise Days was formed in 1981 by Luciano Brambilla and David Le Breton. Throughout the 1980s, they self-released many cassettes, as well as the renowned masterpiece Grey Skies / Blurred 7”. They were a runner up for a Radio Luxembourg song contest in 1985 with “Tonight” and had subsequent re-releases in 2009, 2017 and 2018. Their music can be described as melodic, emotive cold/minimal wave. David Le Breton and Luchie met at a nightclub on the surfers beach at St. Ouens, Jersey, called “Waves” that played alternative music at the peak of disco and MOR music. Luchie noticed that David’s black leather jacket had Killing Joke written on the back in white lettering went over and spoke to him about the band. After chatting they decided that they both had similar ideas and a passion for music and decided they to form a band and took their name from an Echo & the Bunnymen song. At this time they had a Hondo II electric guitar, a cheap bass guitar, some Casio keyboards (MT30 & VL Tone), a vintage microphone and various analogue effects. They decided that unlike other local bands they would initially perform only original music and no cover songs. Some covers such as “Julia’s Song” by OMD and “She’s lost control” and “ Love will tear us apart” by Joy Division as well as a Jean Michel-Jarre cover eventually entered their sets. They played many live gigs in Jersey starting with their own instrumental intro music “Fragments of glass (hide my eyes)” which had delayed Russian radio broadcasts incorporated and their own light show. Chris Petra the sound engineer then became the bass player contributing bass to later songs such as “scattering seeds” and “feed the flame” etc. Initially David used a kit synth called a Transcendent 2000 and then the band bought some Roland equipment namely two SH100 mono synths , a TR606 Drumatix drum machine and Juno 6 poly synth, and a Yamaha SK10 strings keyboard with an SM58 mike which these to record onto a reel to reel Sony TC377. Luchie acquired a Yamaha SG1000 and Fender Stratocastor guitar as well as various Ibanez and bus effects pedals played through a Vox AC30.

However, in the recent years, much has been re-released and is available on various digital platforms, vinyl and cassettes."

      "description": "Cinema Strange is a gothic/death rock band from Southern California, founded as a high school four piece in 1994. Their origins were rooted in the traditional death rock sounds of the 1980’s, inspired by acts such as the Sex Gang Children, Southern Death Cult, Bauhaus, and Christian Death. 1994 saw the release of their demo cassette featuring vocalist Lucas Lanthier, guitarist Colin O’Donnell, bassist Daniel Ribiat, and drummer Alex Restrepo. They would go on to simplify their lineup to two members, Lucas on vocals and Daniel on bass, with accompanied synths and drum machine to fill out their change in sound. This can be heard on their second cassette ‘Acrobat Amaranth Automaton’, released in 1996. Michael Ribiat, youngest sibling of Daniel, was playing keyboards in his own high school formed death rock band Vox ab Nihil along with vocalist James Powell, bass player Joshua Moreau, and drummer Danny Walker, while learning to play and add guitar to his repertoire. He would occasionally play guitar during Cinema Strange practices which would lead towards his addition in the band for three out of their four newer songs recorded for two separate 7” vinyl releases, as well as contributing keyboards for their cover of David Bowie’s ‘Time’ on the Cleopatra Records tribute compilation ‘Goth Oddity’ released in 1999. Cinema Strange, now a touring three-piece, would go on to sign with German record label Trisol, which saw the rerelease of their second cassette and two 7” vinyl records onto a singular self titled cd by the year 2000. This would be followed up by their album ‘The Astonished Eyes Of Evening’ released in 2002. In 2004 they would release a limited edition boxed set titled ‘A Cinema Strange 10th Anniversary Novelty Product’, which included their original 1994 demo, finally on cd, accompanied by a reworking of the same material with Michael now on guitar, and the addition of former Vox ab Nihil drummer Danny Walker to the group. A dvd home video release titled ‘Pressed Flowers / Squashed Blossoms’ followed in 2005. Including both a live show from 11/15/03 in Strasbourg, as well as a documentary directed by both Lucas Lanthier and former Cinema Strange drummer Alex Restrepo. Lucas would go on to start another music project known as The Deadfly Ensemble with former Vox ab Nihil vocalist James Powell on various instruments. In 2006 they would release their first album ‘An Entire Wardrobe Of Doubt And Uncertainty’ on Trisol. Also in 2006 Cinema Strange, now back to being a quartet, would release their album ‘Quatorze Exemples Authentiques Du Triomphe De La Musique Décorative’ on cd. This included a second disc of two short stories, both written and read by Lucas. Since their 2006 album release they have played live shows sporadically throughout the years. Lucas has continued to tour with his project The Deadfly Ensemble, also at times solo under just Lucas Lanthier. He has even performed entire shows of Cinema Strange material under variations of the name Lucas Lanthier and His Esteemed Colleagues."

      "country": "F",
      "genre": "Post-Punk",
      "description": "Formerly from Toulouse (southern France), SOROR DOLOROSA was originally founded in 2001, with Andy (Nuit Noire, Mutiilation, Peste Noire, Celestia, Darvulia, Fornication) on drums, Franck (ex Funeraell) on guitar, Herve (ex Funeraell) on bass, and Christophe Guenot (ex Funeraell) on vocals. Herve came up with the name of SOROR DOLOROSA because of a novel titled \"Bruges-la-morte\" by Georges Rodenbach, a Flemish symbolist writer from the late 19th century. A novel marked by symbolism of nostalgia and mourning. SOROR DOLOROSA means \"Sister Pain\" in Latin, one could almost translate it as \"lovers of pain\" in a more Baudelaire way... The band recorded an unpublished demo, then the line-up changed in 2003 with the arrival of Emey (ex Contrast, Unscarred ...), who replaced Franck on guitar. Subsequently they recorded a second unpublished demo and did some gigs until they split in 2005. In August 2007 they reformed with the present line up. A month later, based on songs written by bassist Carles Herve, the band recorded a third unpublished demo whose content sounds definitely Gothic Rock and Death Rock, influenced by groups such as Christian Death, Bauhaus, and The Sisters of Mercy. From that time, Soror Dolorosa's style became more personal and they found an own identity as a band. The songs were now written by the four members together, though still mostly based on the bass guitar. They took on a Cold Wave colouring, more in line with bands such as The Cure or Human League, but also with hints of 70's rock like Deep Purple or Black Sabbath and retaining the Sisters of Mercy-like Gothic Rock influence. Soror Dolorosa made their first record appearance with \"American Chronicle\" in March 2008, on the free compilation \"Poisoned Dead Frogs\" (Manic Depression): http://www.manicdepressionrecords.com/frogs.php When the third demo was out on myspace, the group was contacted to release an EP through the British label Todestrieb Records. This 6 track EP, entitled \"Severance\", wasn't released until August 2009 due to production delays and is being distributed through underground ways, while the band promoted it with successful live performances all over France. Some time in 2009, through the help of Neige (Amesoeurs, Alcest), the band came in contact with Northern Silence Productions, who offered to release their upcoming albums on their newly founded sublabel Beneath Grey Skies, and subsequently produced the debut full length \"Blind Scenes\", recorded in August 2010 at Drudenhaus Studio. To use the band's own words: \"The album is quite cold, with misty blue moods. 'Blind Scenes' would rather be perceived as scenes unseen, that is to say, out of time and out of the real world. As a state of grace overshadowed by the inevitability of everyday life. The lyrics are heartfelt and talk about regrets, coldness, alcohol abuse, as well as forfeiture, but mostly nostalgia, hence the blue color of the music.\" That's also why they chose \"Drudenhaus Studio\" (CNK, Alcest, Les Discrets, Varsovie, Necroblaspheme), recommended by Neige, who described it as an ideal place to record their music. On the one hand because the studio is analog, and on the other hand because it is located in Brittany's countryside, isolated from the rest of the world, with compulsory rain in August. It was produced by Benoit Roux \"Mr. Xort\" (ex Anorexia Nervosa), who recorded additional keyboards. The album artwork & layout was done by Metastazis, who is one of the best illustrators/designers of the underground scene and worked for Alcest, Anathema, Antaeus, Enthroned, Forgotten Woods, Gorgoroth, Immolation, Secrets of the Moon, Taake, Listenable Records, Osmose Productions & Warner Bros. So, that's how Soror Dolorosa appear today, which is quite a feat, knowing their respective influences. Andy, as a drummer, has been marked by Black Metal and Metal in general but also by the likes of Human League, Fields of the Nephilim or Ulver's latest albums. Herve is a big fan of The Cure, Depeche Mode and Christian Death. Emey is somewhat influenced by Metallica, Satriani, Vai, but also Blues & Movie Soundtracks. Franck listens to bands as diverse as Iron Maiden, Bon Jovi or The French Variety, as well as Reggae, although he is primarily a Beatles fan. However, since the basics for their songs often come from bass riffs, the colour of the music naturally goes into the direction of Gothic/Death Rock and Cold Wave."

      "genre": "Post-Punk",
      "description": "With their roots embedded in the early punk era, New Model Army were formed in Bradford, Yorkshire, England, in 1980, and immediately outlined their manifesto by naming themselves after the Sir Thomas Fairfax/Oliver Cromwell revolutionary army. The group was led by Justin \"Slade The Leveller\" Sullivan (b. 1956, Buckinghamshire, England; guitar, vocals), a former platform sweeper and Mars bar production-line worker, with the help of Stuart Morrow (b. 1966, Bradford, England) on bass guitar and Phil Tomkins on drums. Within a few months, Tompkins had been replaced on drums by Rob Waddington, and this line-up remained unchanged until the summer of 1982, when Waddington left the band and was replaced by Robert \"Robb\" Heaton (b. 1962, Cheshire, England d. Nov. 4th, 2004), a former drum technician and occasional drummer for the band Hawkwind. This line-up remained together until Morrow left the band for personal reasons, during the band's \"No Rest\" tour, the day after a concert in their home town of Bradford. Which was coincidentally the day of the Bradford disaster, May 11th, 1985 He was replaced on bass in the summer by Jason \"Moose\" Harris (b. 1968). Their brand of punk folk/rock attracted a loyal cult following, much of which shared the band's grievances towards the Tory government policies of the 80s. This was best executed on their debut album, which combined militant themes such as \"Spirit Of The Falklands\" and \"Vengeance\" (a vitriolic anthem about getting even with one's trespassers) with the haunting lament for childhood, \"A Liberal Education\". The group's championing of traditional working-class ethics saw an unexpected boost for a dying art and trade - that of the clog. New Model Army made their first public appearance at Scamps Disco in Bradford in October 1980. After releasing singles on Abstract Records, enjoying a number 2 UK independent chart hit with \"The Price\" in 1984, they formed an unlikely alliance with the multinational EMI Records, which saw the band acquire a higher profile and a significantly increased recording budget. They eventually broke through to a wider audience with \"No Rest\", which peaked at number 28 on the UK singles chart in 1985 - a position they were never to beat in an impressive run of 12 UK chart singles between 1985 and 1991. With often inflammatory lyrics, the band have never compromised their beliefs for commercial gain. They ran into trouble with BBC Television's Top Of The Pops show for donning T-shirts with the (albeit laudable) slogan, \"Only Stupid Bastards Use Heroin\". This attracted some derision from \"anarcho-punk\" traditionalists , who replied with their own motif: \"Only Stupid Bastards Help EMI\". They subsequently continued to release high-quality albums, with considerable crossover potential, always maintaining credibility with their original fanbase. In December 1991 the group left EMI, eventually finding a new home on Epic Records. Their first single for the label revealed few concessions to the mainstream: \"Here Comes The War\" featured a picture of a charred body, and a pull-out poster instructing the user in how to prepare a nuclear bomb. In 1994, a dance remix of \"Vengeance' was released as a protest against the Criminal Justice Bill. After a lengthy absence the band reconvened for 1998's \"Strange Brotherhood\". New Model Army's short spell with Epic ended as quickly as it started with the band preferring to self publish and go back to their roots. By 2000 their most recent studio album was ready. Named \"Eight\" it included a now familiar, though no less effective, formula and energy. They continue to release new material and tour as of 2023."

This line up recorded an album in Watts' Hamburg studio which was shelved at the time and did not get released in its entirety until 2022. Mur then went on to collaborate with producer Dieter Meier to work on her 1988 self-titled debut for RCA. A follow-up album, \"Warsaw\", was recorded in 1990, but went unreleased at the time. After this, Mona decided to take a break from singing, and turned her energy to taekwondo, achieving 3rd dan. She entered the German national team and became international German vice champion twice.
